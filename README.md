# Slideshow

A script that makes slides from elements. This code uses 4 Divs, 4 Headers, 4 Text Lines, and 4 Dot Triggers. Using triggers you can switch between 4 slides. Also added to the code a timer that swaps through the slides every 10 seconds. Has also been added a script that changes slides using swipe to left or right with finger on the mobile version. When manually switching a slide by pressing the trigger or swiping with your finger, the timer resets for 10 seconds. After the last slide, the script returns the slide to the first and swapping continues.
